### How do I use it?

The most barebones configuration would be:

```yaml
- name: Install Arturo
  uses: arturo-lang/arturo-action@main
  with: 
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Based on the runner, the action will compile and setup the appropriate, native *full* version of Arturo:

| runner | binary |
|--------|--------|
| ubuntu-latest | amd64 / Linux |
| macos-12 | amd64 / macOS |
| macos-latest | arm64 (M1) / macOS |
| windows-latest | amd64 / Windows |

#### More options

| option | description |
|--------|-------------|
| mode   | this can be either `full` or `mini` for now (default: `full`) |
| arch   | the target architecture (default: `native`) - the main use is to compile for `arm64` on Linux |
